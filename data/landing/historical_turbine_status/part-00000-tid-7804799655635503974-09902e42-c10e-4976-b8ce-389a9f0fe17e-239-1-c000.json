Replace worn-out bearings, realign gear meshes, and replenish gearbox oil with a high-quality, temperature-resistant lubricant. Implement enhanced lubrication maintenance practices, including oil filtration and temperature monitoring, to optimize gearbox performance and extend service life. Conduct regular vibration analysis and thermal imaging inspections to detect early signs of gearbox issues and prevent catastrophic failures.\n"}
